# Genetic Algorithm

A genetic algorithm solution.

Explores the benefit of machine learning classification in the evolutionary loop.

## Future Work

* Track variables that Dr. Ferguson requested

## Traveling Salesman Example

Minimization problem

You can compare the top 10 salesman routes with and without machine learning (at 1000 objective function evaluations). The machine learning routes are notably consistent and better (shorter).
